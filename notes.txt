chpater 61: The DOM: Junk artifacts and nodeType

Previous Lecture (Qucik Recap)
     The DOM : finding children 
         children : Return only child elements (actual html elements like h1, p , span , div etc)
         childNodes : Return all child nodes , including text nodes , comments , etc.

    what are Junk artifacts     
       when working  with the DOM , especially when iterating through child nodes , we may
       encounter nodes that are not elements . These are often refferred to as "Junk artifacts"

       COMMON JUNK ARTIFACTS:
          Text nodes: These are created by spaces, line breaks , or text content within the html. 
          comment Nodes : Nodes created by HTML comments.

    Practicle Example:       
        Junk-artifacts.html

    explaination:
       Elements Nodes : Represented by actual HTML tags like <p> or <span>.
       Text Nodes : Represented by text or spaces between elements.
       comment nodes : Represented by HTML comments.

WHAT is nodeType property?       
    The nodeType property Returs the node type , as a number , of the specified node.

    if the node is an element node, the nodeType property will Return 1.
    if the node is an attribute node, the nodeType property will Return 2.
    if the node is an text node, the nodeType property will Return 3.
    if the node is an comment node, the nodeType property will Return 8.
    This property is read-only.
